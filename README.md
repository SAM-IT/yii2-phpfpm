# yii2-phpfpm
Run Yii2 on PHP-FPM

This package allows you to build docker containers that run your Yii application.
The module adds a command to build a container that will run just PHP-FPM.

It can be combined with [sam-it/yii-static-assets](https://github.com/SAM-IT/yii2-static-assets) which creates an nginx container.
